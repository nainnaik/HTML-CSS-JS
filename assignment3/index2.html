			<p>Combine parsley, rosemary, garlic, Dijon, and 1 tablespoon oil in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Place 8 lemon slices and half of rosemary mixture underneath skin of chicken, dividing evenly. Rub remaining rosemary mixture over chicken, dividing evenly. Roast, on a rimmed baking sheet, 20 to 22 minutes.
			Meanwhile, toss Broccolini, onion, red pepper, remaining lemon slices, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper.

			Serve with red pepper for sprinkling</p>
			<p>Combine chicken, onion, bell pepper, garlic, stock, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chiles, chili powder, oregano, and cumin in a 4-quart slow cooker. Season with salt and pepper.

			<h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>			
			<p>Lay beef strips out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow to dry in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, rice vinegar, orange juice concentrate, salt and soy sauce. Set aside.
			Meanwhile, combine rice and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Add more water at the end if necessary.
			Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Toss dried beef in cornstarch to coat. Fry in the hot oil in small batches until crispy and golden brown; set aside. Drain all of the oil from the wok except about 1 tablespoon.
			Add orange zest, ginger and garlic to the remaining oil, and cook briefly until fragrant. Add the soy sauce mixture to the wok, bring to a boil, and cook until thick and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Add beef, and heat through, stirring to coat. Serve immediately over steamed rice, and garnish with broccoli.

			<h2 class="text-center"> Sushi </h2>			
			<p>In a medium saucepan, bring 1 1/3 cups water to a boil. Add rice, and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar ,and salt. Blend the mixture into the rice.
			Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). On a medium baking sheet, heat nori in the preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until warm.
			Center one sheet nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, and imitation crabmeat in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
			Cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices using a wet, sharp knife
